# General questions 

    * This week we learned Python and dat structures using python and Javascript
    * I love the challenge and problem solving aspect
    * a recent technical challenge I solved was from my 3rd project from General Assembly. We needed to deiplay many different items on a page and to do that in a MERN app
      I needed to wrap all the contents into a Modal.
